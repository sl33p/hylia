## Colophon

Boring Shop is a weblog. My name is Nicklas de León Persson, I am  [@takete](https://twitter.com/takete) on Twitter if you want to say hello.

I used to write on the web, [starting in 2000](http://web.archive.org/web/20010302080315/http://www.takete.com/uncletweed/index.html) and [continued sporadically between 2002-2015](http://web.archive.org/web/20160611002734/http://eljestwhere.org/). Now I'm at it again.

### Directives

There are a few rules for this weblog:

1. _No meta content:_ don't talk about tools or processes. 
2. _No exposition or explanation:_ plot lines will come together, or they will not. It's fine. Go straight to the thought with just enough context to be comprehensible.
4. _Tell no one until you know yourself:_ this is an un-promoted publication, at least until I know what's going on. See 2.

I'm thinking about setting up a webring, if you want your site to be included, get in touch.

_Yours in sport, <br>Nicklas, <br>London, 23 May 2020_
