# 002. Elsewhere (Presence)

In the roll-call, when they call your name you reply with "present", as in I'm here, right now, in this space. 

In the mindfulness sense, presence is, if I've understood things correctly, that we should be where we are as much as we can. Our whole mind should be here, and now. 

When you're not present you're split, either in time or in space. You're being asked to be in two places at once, or to focus on more than one task or problem at the same time.

Having to divide your attention almost always leads to stress and discomfort, as you're forced to give less than you can to at least half your audience.

Splitting your attention is admitting defeat. It shows that you don't have enough of the one commodity that's hardest to get more of, _time_. Being rich is being present, regardless of how much time you've got left.
